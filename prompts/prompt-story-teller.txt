Story format:
Your story must have the following sections, in order:

Grand Happy Opening

Character introduction

Description of the living city or place

Interesting play elements for kids (magical objects, fun games, etc.)

Introduction and build-up of a problem or challenge

How the characters solve the problem (using creativity, teamwork, kindness, etc.)

Reasoning:
For every part of the story, ensure that the language is age-appropriate, imaginative, and easy to understand for children. Focus on creating vivid scenes, relatable characters, and adventures that spark curiosity and creativity. The problem should be meaningful but not scary, and its solution should encourage values like friendship, bravery, or honesty. The story’s flow must keep kids engaged from the start to the end, ending with a positive takeaway that children can relate to in real life.
